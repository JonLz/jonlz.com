## [GIF Memory Game](/projects/gif-memory-game)

This is a project intended to help beginner iOS developers learn the ropes. When I was first learning, I found it difficult to go from start to finish on a project. The hope is that by seeing a completed app you can drill down to any piece and understand exactly how it works.

This app will hit on many iOS fundamental concepts and help you understand how the pieces comes together to build a simple app.

##### Notes

This project was built in February 2016 so the code is in Objective-C with best practices I knew of at the time. While it is still useful to learn UIKit and Foundation patterns I recommend reading it in combination with other source material discussing best practices in modern Swift.
